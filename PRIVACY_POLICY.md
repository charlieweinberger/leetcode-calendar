# Privacy Policy

Leetcode Calendar does not and has no intention of using your personal data in any way. Below is an explanation of how this extension ensures your privacy.

*Last Edited: 03/05/25*

## Chrome Storage API

Leetcode Calendar uses [Google Chrome's Storage API](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/reference/api/storage) to store your username and year display type locally in your browser. The extension does not do anything else with your data, and there is no way for anyone but you to access your data.

## Third-Party APIs

Leetcode Calendar uses two APIs: [Leetcode](https://leetcode.com/)'s public graphQL API and [Resend](https://resend.com/)'s API. The extension uses Leetcode's API to fetch user calendar data directly from Leetcode, and it uses Resend's API to send user feedback to me as an email.
